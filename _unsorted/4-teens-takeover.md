Attention all teens! Tired of studying? Need a break from all the mugging? Join us for a time of chillaxing in the library! With a space specially reserved for teens to play and snacks to be eaten, what’s not to love about this event? Grab your friends and get ready to TakeOver the programme zone. Claim your rightful throne!

Come hang with us at these locations!
