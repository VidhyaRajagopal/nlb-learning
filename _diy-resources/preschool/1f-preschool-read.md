## **Read**

### **Introduction**

Reading with children develops their language and literacy skills.  Words can be found all around us, for example, on cereal boxes and advertisements.  Recognising such environmental print allows children to differentiate text from pictures at an early age by reading the words in their immediate surroundings. 

Reading books to children teaches them how to handle books as well as how text flows from left to right and from top to bottom of a page.  In addition, books expose children to words they may not learn through daily conversation.  Parents should also talk to children about what they have read together to help them understand the story. 

### **Recommended Activities**

**Invisible Words**
To prepare for this activity, first use white crayon to write letters or words on white paper. Your child can then use watercolours to paint over the paper to find the hidden invisible letters or words. Older children can try their hand at writing hidden messages for their parents too.

To extend the activity, you can ask your child to match the revealed letters or words against a checklist of words or related pictures.

**Secret Code**
Play a secret code game with your child! Write the alphabet at the bottom of a page and next to each letter, indicate a number or coloured sticker to represent that letter. Decide on a secret word. For each letter of the word, draw a box on the paper. Fill each box with the number or coloured sticker that represents that letter. Your child will then try to decipher secret word using the code at the bottom of the page.

To add on to the activity, you can ask your child to locate letter figures hidden in a sensory bin, and place them accordingly onto the boxes drawn on paper.

**Matching Words**
Prepare a deck of self-made alphabet (or word) cards. Make sure there are two cards for each letter of the alphabet (or word). Deal the cards face down. Now get your child to find pairs of identical letters or words. This is done through flipping over two face-down cards. If the two cards are not identical, turn them face down and try again. Parents can emphasise the sounds of the letters or words and adjust the difficulty level through the number of cards used.

To add on to the activity, you can guide your child to form simple words or sentences with the letters and words from the matching activity.
