## **Play**

### **Introduction**

Play enables children to develop their language, social-emotional and cognitive skills. It also encourages imagination and creativity. Learning through play comes in many forms such as imaginary play, cooperative play and physical play. They are further categorised into instructional play, games, guided play and free play, depending on the degree of which children are given control over their experiences during play.

### **Recommended Activities**

**Name Art**
Collect fallen leaves, twigs and flowers while enjoying a walk in the park. Grab a piece of drawing paper and write your child’s name.

Get your child to fill in the spaces with the natural materials you have gathered. If you would like to keep the name art, you can use clear glue to stick the materials onto the paper.

This activity helps your child recognize alphabets while connecting with nature. For other name art variations, you can use small pebbles, shells, sand or other type of natural materials.

**Make with Shapes**
Grab a few sheets of coloured construction paper. Cut out different shapes in varying sizes. To make it easier for your child to identify different shapes, assign a colour to a shape.

Prepare a deck of flash cards with your child’s favourite things such as animals, vehicles and food. You may use text or visuals, whichever is comfortable for your child. Place them face down in front of your child. Get your child to pick a flash card and turn it over. Arrange the different shapes to form the item shown on the flash card.

Make the activity more challenging by introducing other shapes such as rhombus, octagon and trapezium.

**Colours and Numbers**
In this activity, your child will learn about colours and counting from numbers 1 to 5. First, grab a piece of white paper and draw lines across it randomly. The lines may cross each other.

Print out the table below and cut along the lines.

Separate the slips of paper into two groups – numbers and colours, and place the slips into two separate envelopes. Get your child to pick one slip from each envelope.

The number slip indicates the number of spaces to fill in on the paper with lines that you have drawn, and the colour slip indicates the colour to use to fill in the spaces. For example, if your child picked “2” and “Blue”, he/she will have to choose two spaces to colour in with blue.

Make the activity more exciting and challenging by introducing other numbers and colours for your child to choose.
