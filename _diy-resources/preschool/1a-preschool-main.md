## **Early Literacy Practices**

_(Updated on 4 September 2020)_

Research shows that there are early literacy skills that children need to pick up on their way to becoming fluent readers:

**Letter Knowledge**
Recognising letters and knowing their names and sounds.

**Narrative Skills**
Being able to describe objects and events.

**Phonological Awareness**
Understanding that words are made of smaller sounds and being able to hear and play with these smaller sounds.

**Print Awareness**
Understanding that the print on a page represent words and knowing how to follow the words on a page and use a book.

**Vocabulary**
Knowing the names of things, feelings and concepts.
