## **Talk**

### **Introduction**

Talking helps a child develop early literacy skills. Nurture your babbling baby into a talkative toddler by talking and reading to him often. Talking is also an excellent way to build his narrative skills. These skills are needed to help him with reading as he grows older.

Read aloud and encourage your child to read along with you. You can initiate conversations about stories by asking, “What do you see on this page?” or “What do you think will happen next?”

## **Recommended Activities**

**Explore Wordless Picture Books**
Wordless picture books are picture books that do not contain any words, only illustrations. They provide a wonderful opportunity for you to bond with your child as you go through the pages together, telling the story as you go.

For older children, encourage them to tell the story in their own words. Help them out by asking questions such as, “What do you think is happening?” or “How do you think this character is feeling?” This will develop your child’s observational and language skills, while exercising his creativity and imagination.

**Fun with Rhymes**
Lemon, lime, dime, climb – which word does not rhyme? Play a game with rhyming words with your child. Encourage him to listen carefully and point out the word that does not rhyme. Everyday objects at home can be used for playing too! Pick out a few items such as a chair, a teddy bear and a comb and ask your child to choose the object that does not rhyme with the rest.

For younger children, point to the objects that rhyme (for example, a chair and a bear) and say their names. Encourage him to repeat after you if he can.

**Guess the Object**
Build your child’s vocabulary by playing a “Guess the Object” game with him. This game can be played anywhere, whether you are out and about or at home. The next time when you are at the supermarket with you child, get him to guess what you are describing. Give him clues such as, “This object is red and round. It is sweet and juicy.” (The answer to this is apple!)

Take turns doing this and have him describe something that he sees to you, for you to guess. The number of things to describe and guess is endless!

As Thomas opens up the little book, so does the reader! Within the little book, the story repeats— until Thomas, this time walking through quiet, snowy woods, finds another smaller book, with an even stranger adventure within it. Wandering again through the third book, Thomas finally hears familiar voices and ends up reuinted with his family. But what adventures lay ahead . . . ?

One of these things is almost like the others…

Behold this artful and unusual odd-one-out board book for the youngest readers, featuring a much-loved theme: food! Bastien Contraire masterfully creates spreads with six to eight images each, all of which belong together, except one that may resemble the others but has no business joining the rest. An umbrella among mushrooms, a snake among vegetables, and a canoe among pastries are all hiding in plain sight for the delighted toddler to giddily discover! Young readers will exercise skills of categorization and visual acuity in finding the “imposter”, and bask in the preposterous silliness. This is the third book in Contraire’s collectible Hide and Sneak series.
