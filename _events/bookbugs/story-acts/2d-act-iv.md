## **Act IV: The Skirmish at SengKang**

Following Nostro’s instructions, Petra made her way to Sengkang Public Library with a heavy heart. Her moth senses were tingling; trouble must be brewing there.

The library was eerily quiet. Not knowing what to expect, Petra remained on her guard as she explored the library. When she finally reached the Children’s Section, a gasp escaped her lips. She could not believe what she was seeing.

The Children’s Section was an utter mess! Books were strewn all over the floor with the different bugs dancing around them. The walls were also filled with their “artwork”.

Glancing at the clock on the wall, she noticed that it was already 10.55am – five minutes to opening time, but the library was nowhere near presentable!

Petra’s forehead wrinkled in concentration. Thankfully, she had managed to conjure a temporary illusion to conceal the disarray just in time, so the humans found nothing amiss. She then made her way to the group of dancing bugs. Approaching the bug closest to her, she grabbed his shoulder and shook him so hard that his head wobbled back and forth.

“Byte! Listen to me, you’ve got to wake up! This isn’t you!”

From the shadows came a voice, “Save your breath, Petra. It’s futile.”

Skorpius walked out with an evil gleam in his eyes.

“Skorpius, it doesn’t have to be this way. Let’s talk it out.”

Skorpius snorted, “Talk? I don’t recall a lot of talking when you guardians sealed me in the book. Besides, it’s too late to cut a bargain. I’ve grown tired of your incessant chatter. Let’s dance, shall we?”

In a flash, Skorpius aimed the skull artefact at Petra and a red laser beam shot out of it. With her amazing reflexes and agility, Petra dodged the beam.

“You leave me with no choice. If it’s a fight you want, it’s a fight you’ll get,” Petra declared, as she readied herself for battle.

With another flutter of her wings, glitter dust rained down and there were now multiple copies of herself surrounding Skorpius.

“Give up now Skorpius! Don’t make the same mistake – don’t let history repeat itself!”

The copies lashed out at Skorpius only to crumple onto the floor. Skorpius had appeared behind the real Petra. His pincer firmly gripped her head; he could eliminate her at any moment.

“Victors write their own histories.”

“You won’t win. I’ve seen it in your future.” Petra closed her eyes, readying herself for the final blow.

“Arrogant till the end. How boring. I expected you to grovel a little.” The vengeful scorpion continued menacingly, “My plan is in motion, my victory is inevitable.”

With an evil cackle, Skorpius vanished into thin air. It became apparent that he was never really at the library to begin with.

Petra raced out of the library to regroup with the other guardians, for Skorpius had become more powerful than before.
