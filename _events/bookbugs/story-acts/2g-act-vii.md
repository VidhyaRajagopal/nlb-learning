## **Act VII: The Shortsighted**

The Guardians have prepared to infiltrate Skorpius’ heavily guarded den where all the unsorted books are kept. Before they could take a step, Petra’s wings started glowing a foreboding red. She signaled for everyone to halt.

“Skorpius is no fool. We need to think this through and come up with a very good plan if we want to defeat him.”

Everyone kept quiet as they pondered their options. After a while, Shenlong replied, “I might have a plan, but it’s… a little crazy.”

“This den is most likely swamped with guard bugs both inside and out. Aurelius and I will team up to distract the guard-bugs outside. The rest of you will remain in hiding and only infiltrate the den when you see my signal.”

Turning to face Petra, she continued, “Petra, once inside, I need you to find a way to distract all the guard-bugs.”

“Rembrandt and Nostro, once the coast is clear, search the premises for the book. Turn the place upside-down if you have to. We must find the book!”

The Guardians saluted and made their way to their positions.

Giving Shenlong a brief nod, Aurelius summoned his paper plane. The two  bugs jumped on and flew towards the unsuspecting guard-bugs.

Shenlong closed her eyes in concentration as she called forth a great hailstorm. Dark cumulonimbus clouds formed and from them, icy hail fell, hitting every single guard-bug. Reinforcements came swiftly; however, the newly-arrived guard-bugs stared at the clouds in confusion, with no idea about who or what was causing this mysterious phenomenon. Meanwhile, Aurelius, the warrior-bug trained in mixed martial arts, had jumped off his paper plane and was dealing his enemies a crushing defeat.

Shenlong surveyed the scene from the clouds and saw that the guard-bugs outside were being distracted by Aurelius. It was time to put Part Two of the plan into action. With a flick of her wings, a blinding white bolt of lightning came crashing down. It was the signal the other Guardians had been waiting for.

Nostro, Petra and Rembrandt dashed towards the entrance and successfully infiltrated the den. While Nostro and Rembrandt found places to hide, Petra gave her wings a little flutter and became invisible by manipulating the guard-bugs’ perceptions. With everyone in place, she started searching for the Security Office.

Once inside the office, she began typing furiously on the control panel, deactivating security cameras and opening all entrances and exits.

Linking the PA system to a voice synthesiser, she spoke into the mic. Her clear, bright voice was altered, sounding more robotic and mechanised.

“Security breach at Section 398.2, trespassers are moving toward the book location. Backup is required. All guards must leave their designated positions immediately to protect the Book.  “

After Petra’s announcement, there was a flurry of movement in the hallway as the guards began mobilising.

With the distraction in place, Nostro and Rembrandt started their search. The first few rooms were a bust but when they made their way to the room furthest away from the entrance, the book was there.

“Nostro, grab the book and let’s go!” Rembrandt shouted in glee as he stood at the doorway to keep a lookout for the guards.

When he realised there was no movement behind him, he turned around and let out a loud gasp.

“You’re not Nostro…”
